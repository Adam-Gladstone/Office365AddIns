Data*: the information you want to visualise
Mapping*: the description of how the data’s variables are mapped to aesthetic attributes.
	Layers*: A layer is a collection of geometric elements and statistical transformations
		geoms
		stats
	Scales: Scales map values in the data space to values in the aesthetic space
	Coordinates: A coord describes how data coordinates are mapped to the plane of the graphic
	Facets: A facet specifies how to break up and display subsets of data as small multiples
	Theme: A theme controls the finer points of display, like the font size and background colour


The three key components of every plot: data, aesthetics and geoms

* Almost every plot maps a variable to x and y, so naming these aesthetics is tedious, so the first two unnamed arguments to aes() will be mapped to x and y.
* colour, shape and size => when passed as top-level aes, the colour, shape and size are mapped from factors AND added to the legend; if passed without aes(...) directly to geom, then the mapping is applied as above but does not appear in the legend. Some care required when passing colours into geoms OUTSIDE of an aes(...)
ie. this works: geom_point(aes(colour = class))
but this doesn't: geom_point(colour = class)
NOTE: This is saying something different: the first is saying map different classes (2seater, compact, suv...) to different colours; the second is saying draw the points in the colour - which in this case is not a colour.

* Another technique for displaying additional categorical variables on a plot is faceting (instead of trying to display a single graph with all classes of vehicles for example). Faceting creates tables of graphics by splitting the data into subsets and displaying the same graph for each subset. 

NOTE: Bar charts can be confusing because there are two rather different plots that are both commonly called bar charts. The above form expects you to have unsummarised data, and each observation contributes one unit to the height of each bar. The other form of bar chart is used for presummarised data. For example, you might have three drugs with their average effect:

Aesthetics
----------
// https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/basic-aesthetics.html#coloring-structural-elements
Some aesthetics need to be nested within aes() and some do not. 
How do we know when to place them outside versus inside?

- Aesthetics for a specific variable of your data go inside aes().
- An aesthetic that will remain a constant value – irrespective of the values of your data – should be placed outside of aes() and within the geom element.

Facet wraps are a useful way to view individual CATEGORIES in their own graph.
For example, if you wanted to make a separate graph for each cut measuring the price (y axis) for each clarity (x axis), you could add facet_wrap(~cut).
The tilde (~) can be read as “by” as in: > “I want to make a new graph separated by cut categories.”
Further, you can specify the number of columns/rows to display as such
